## Is this a clone?
Yes. This is a clone of the [One Ummah Bd](https://oneummahbd.com/), a website for a local business in Bangladesh. It's not a 100% clone. I only implemented the features that I thought were necessary for the project (based on the assignment requirements). I should also note here that, few days before finishing the project the original website's landing page got a big redesign,which I did not implement. So, you might see a lot of differences between the original landing page and the clone.
